#Metro.GlobalComponentPersonalization (GCP)

##Description
GCP is a proof-of-concept for doing site-independend global personalization of the components.
You can configure set of rules to be always evaluated for particular component within a site context. You can store all these rule settings in any location, so you can have flexible configuration for different security scenarios.  

##Get started

##Supported versions
